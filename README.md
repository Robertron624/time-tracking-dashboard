## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) - For state management


### What I learned

With this project I learned more of grid layout and how to use it to create a responsive design. I also learned how to use Sass with React and how to mix it with css modules. I also learned how to use Zustand for state management (to handle the change of the active frametime).


### Continued development

I want to keep learning more about grid layout and how to use it to create responsive designs. I also want to keep learning more about Sass and how to use it with React. I also want to keep learning more about Zustand and how to use it for state management, I think it's a lot easier than alternatives like redux.

### Useful resources

- [How to Use SASS and CSS Modules with create-react-app](https://blog.bitsrc.io/how-to-use-sass-and-css-modules-with-create-react-app-83fa8b805e5e) - This helped me to learn how to use SASS with React css modules. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Zustand documentation](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction) - This is the official documentation for Zustand. I really liked this library and it's a great alternative to Redux. I will use it going forward.
